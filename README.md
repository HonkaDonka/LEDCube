## LED Cube 

This project is a 3D matrix of LEDs that can be controlled via the Blynk App. 

It features WiFi compatibility, a clock mode that tells the local time, and an animation player.

Additionally, you can create your own animations simply by using [Piskel](https://www.piskelapp.com/p/create/sprite) and exporting it as a C file!
